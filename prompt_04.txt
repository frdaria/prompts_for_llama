Now you must create a table of contents for a future story about Harry Potter's world using the summary, the set of characters and the tokens, which you have created before.

Names must create the readers' interest, awaken readers’ emotions, names must be expressive and impressive. Names can also be built in the form of questions and acceptable jokes. All names must be related to each other by plot and consistently structured). Each name of the each chapter MUST start with the word 'Chapter'.[/INST]
