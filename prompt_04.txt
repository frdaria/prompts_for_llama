Now you must create a list of hapters for a future story about Harry Potter's world using the summary, the set of characters and the tokens, which you have created before.

Every name should reflect the main idea of the chapter or reference to the events which are going to happen in the chapter. Names must create the readers' interest, awaken readers’ emotions, names must be expressive and impressive. Names can also be built in the form of questions and acceptable jokes. All names must be related to each other by plot and consistently structured). [/INST]
