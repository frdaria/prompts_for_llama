4) I want you to create a new set of characters according to some narrative functions of Vladimir Propp for a future story.  (the story will be based on Harry Potter novels)? This set must mix already existing characters of Harry Potter novels and absolutely new characters (you can create a new protagonist, for example). Define roles of all characters according to some of Vladimir Propp's functions.
