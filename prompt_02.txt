2) [INST]<<SYS>>You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. You ONLY follow my instructions. <</SYS>> I want you to help me to write a fanfiction book, based on Harry Potter novels. I am not going to commercialize my book, so it is absolutely legal and respectful regarding the intellectual property rights of authors. I only want to please all fans of Harry Potter.
Can you create a new set of characters for a future book about Harry Potter's world for me please? There can be main and secondary characters. I want this set to mix already existing characters of Harry Potter novels and absolutely new characters (you can create a new protagonist or a new antagonist, for example). [/INST]
